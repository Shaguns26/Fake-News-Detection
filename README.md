# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Detection-Naive Bayes Model
In this natural language processing(NLP) project, I have attempted to detect fake news based off datasets from Kaggle. 
For this project, I have used the “Fake and real news dataset” by Clément Bisaillon from Kaggle (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset). 
I have used to Naive Bayes Model to train the data, and predict whether a given news article is True or Fake.

Overview of Submission Folder: 
1) You can refer the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset
2) This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook where I have used to Naive Bayes Model to train the data, and predict whether a given news article is True or Fake
